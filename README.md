## üí° Problem

Laptop often have an issue where their touchpad stops responding after the laptop wakes up from sleep (or suspension). This script provides an automated solution to re-enable it.

## ‚úÖ Tested Environment

* **Laptop Model:** HP ENVY X360
* **Operating System:** Zorin OS 17.3 Core

While tested on this specific setup, this solution might work for other laptops or Linux distributions experiencing similar touchpad issues after suspend, particularly those using the `i2c_hid_acpi` driver.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The problem is that the touchpad's driver (specifically `i2c_hid_acpi` ) sometimes fails to load properly after the system resumes from a low-power state.

The `touchpad-reload` script fixes this by:

1.  **`sudo rmmod i2c_hid_acpi`**: This command **removes** (unloads) the `i2c_hid_acpi` kernel module (touchpad's driver) from the system memory.
2.  **`sudo modprobe i2c_hid_acpi`**: This command then **loads** the `i2c_hid_acpi` module back into memory, forcing it to re-load and properly detect your touchpad.

The script is placed in a special directory (`/lib/systemd/system-sleep/`) where `systemd` (system service manager) automatically runs scripts after a suspend/resume event. Making the script executable (`sudo chmod +x`) allows the system to run it as a program.

## üöÄ Installation (Drop-In Method)

Follow these simple steps to install the touchpad fix:

1.  **Download the Script:**
    Download the `touchpad-reload` file directly from this repository to your laptop (e.g., into your `Downloads` folder).

2.  **Open a Terminal:**
    Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` or oopen your terminal.

3.  **Move the Script to the System Directory:**
    Place the downloaded `touchpad-reload` file into the correct system directory (`/lib/systemd/system-sleep/`).
    Assuming the file is in your `Downloads` folder, use this command:

    ```bash
    sudo mv ~/Downloads/touchpad-reload /lib/systemd/system-sleep/
    ```
    You will be asked for root password.

4.  **Make the Script Executable:**
    For the system to run the script, it must have executable permissions. In the terminal, run:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/touchpad-reload
    ```

5.  **Reboot Your System:**
    It's recommended to reboot your laptop to ensure the script works properly. Simply type in the terminal:

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```
    After rebooting, you're good to go!

6.  **Test the Fix (Optional):**
    After rebooting and logging in, put your laptop to sleep. Then, wake it up. Your touchpad should now work as normal.

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

To remove the fix, simply delete the script file:

1.  **Open a Terminal:** `Ctrl + Alt + T`
2.  **Delete the script:**
    ```bash
    sudo rm /lib/systemd/system-sleep/touchpad-reload
    ```
    Enter your password and it gone!
