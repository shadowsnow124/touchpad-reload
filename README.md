# HP Zorin OS Touchpad Reload Script (Post-Suspend Fix)

## üí° Problem

laptop users face an issue where their touchpad stops responding after the laptop wakes up from sleep (suspension). This script provides an automated solution.

## ‚úÖ Tested Environment

* **Laptop Model:** HP ENVY X360
* **Operating System:** Zorin OS 17.3 Core

While tested on this specific setup, this solution might work for other Laptop or Linux distributions experiencing similar touchpad issues after suspend.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The core problem is that the touchpad's driver (specifically `i2c_hid_acpi` for many laptops) sometimes fails to re-initialize properly after the system resumes from a low-power state.

The `touchpad-reload` script fixes this by:

1.  **`sudo rmmod i2c_hid_acpi`**: This command **removes** (unloads) the `i2c_hid_acpi` kernel module (your touchpad's driver) from the system's memory.
2.  **`sudo modprobe i2c_hid_acpi`**: This command then **loads** the `i2c_hid_acpi` module back into memory, forcing it to re-initialize and properly detect your touchpad.

The script is placed in a special directory (`/lib/systemd/system-sleep/`) where `systemd` (your system's service manager) automatically runs scripts after a suspend/resume event. Making the script executable (`sudo chmod +x`) allows the system to run it as a program.

## üöÄ Installation (Drop-In Method)

Follow these simple steps to install the touchpad fix:

1.  **Download the Script:**
    Download the `touchpad-reload` file directly from this repository to your laptop.

2.  **Open a Terminal:**
    Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` on your keyboard.

3.  **Move the Script to the System Directory:**
    Place the downloaded `touchpad-reload` file into the correct system directory (`/lib/systemd/system-sleep/`).
    Assuming the file is in your `Downloads` folder, use this command:

    ```bash
    sudo mv ~/Downloads/touchpad-reload /lib/systemd/system-sleep/
    ```

    You will be ask for your root password.
    
    or just

    ```
    xdg-open /lib/systemd/system-sleep
    ```
    and drop a file into it
    

5.  **Make the Script Executable:**
    For the system to run the script, it must have executable permissions. In the terminal, run:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /lib/systemd/system-sleep/touchpad-reload
    ```


6.  **Reboot Your System:**
    It's recommended to reboot your laptop to ensure it working properly simply type on termial

    ```bash
    sudo reboot
    ```

    than you good to go
    
7.  **Test the Fix:** (optinal)
    After rebooting and logging in, put your laptop to sleep (e.g., close the lid or select "Suspend"). Then, wake it up. Your touchpad should now work as normal.

## üóëÔ∏è Uninstallation

To remove the fix, simply delete the script file:

1.  **Open a Terminal:** `Ctrl + Alt + T`
2.  **Delete the script:**
    ```bash
    sudo rm /lib/systemd/system-sleep/touchpad-reload
    ```
    Enter your password when prompted.

    or

    ```
    xdg-open /lib/systemd/system-sleep/
    ```

    and delete a `tourchpad-reload` file and that it
